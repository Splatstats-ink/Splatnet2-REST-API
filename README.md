# Splatnet2-REST-API
This is the reverse engineering work done on splatnet2's REST API for the backend for use in splatstats.ink.

This builds off the work done by [@ZekeSnider](https://github.com/ZekeSnider) and contributors into [NintendoSwitchRESTAPI](https://github.com/ZekeSnider/NintendoSwitchRESTAPI). If you need help figuring how to get into the API go and have a look at that repo first.

If you need a way to get your iksm_session key, [@frozenpandaman](https://github.com/frozenpandaman) has made an API to get `f` token needed to get the iksm_session via a 3rd party application, you can have a look at the details and requirements to use it over at https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/api-docs
